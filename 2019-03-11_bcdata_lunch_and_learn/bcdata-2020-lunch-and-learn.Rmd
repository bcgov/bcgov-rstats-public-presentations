# What is R?

- R is an open-source programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- In many ways it is similar to other general purpose languages like Python
- originally created as a statistical programming language
- designed from the ground up around the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of data
- easy to make publication-quality graphics.
- available for Windows, MacOS and most popular Linux distributions.
- You can run it interactively by typing directly into the console, or from a sequence of commands written in scripts. 
- Scripts can be run against a dataset to produce a defined output, such as a chart or another dataset which contains the results of the analysis.

# Why R?

The entire workflow can be done efficiently in **R**, including:

- reading in raw data from many different sources - spatial and non-spatial, 
- preparing the data for analysis, including easily integrating tabular and spatial data,
- performing spatial data manipulation and analysis,
- performing statistical analysis
- creating publication-quality graphs and figures.
- All your iteration happens in one place, and is recorded in scripts
- **enables reproducible, repeatable, shareable analysis**

  APIs

Data BC provides important APIs:
  - the catalogue
- search and query data in the catalogue
- Web mapping service
- download spatial data 
- image overlay (WMS) OR the features themselves as points, lines, polygons (WFS)
- most warehouse objects with public record in the catalogue

- Collaboration
- first R package (personally) - sat in a room with a whiteboard and mapped out desired functionality and syntax
- Great approach
- Think landed in a good place
- **Today focus on _getting_ data**

## dplyr verbs

Functions with English meanings that map directly to the action being taken when that function is called

Installation: `install.packages("dplyr")`


.pull-left[
- `%>%` a special symbol to chain operations. Read it as "then"
- `select()` picks variables based on their names.
- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.
- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables

### Select columns (attributes) with select()

```{r, cache=TRUE}
bcdc_query_geodata("municipalities-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc") %>% 
  select(ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION, ADMIN_AREA_GROUP_NAME) #<<
```

???
  
Familiar syntax
Processing on server

---
  
### Filter rows (features) with filter()
  
```{r, cache=TRUE}
bcdc_query_geodata("municipalities-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc") %>% 
  select(ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION, ADMIN_AREA_GROUP_NAME) %>% 
  filter(ADMIN_AREA_GROUP_NAME == "Capital Regional District") #<<
```

---
  
### Get the data with collect()
```{r, echo=FALSE}
mapviewOptions(legend.pos = 'topright')
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
crd_mun <- bcdc_query_geodata("municipalities-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc") %>% 
  select(ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION, ADMIN_AREA_GROUP_NAME) %>% 
  filter(ADMIN_AREA_GROUP_NAME == "Capital Regional District") %>% 
  collect() #<<
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
library(rmapshaper)
crd_mun <- ms_simplify(crd_mun) %>% st_make_valid()
```

```{r}
mapview(crd_mun, zcol = "ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION", layer = "Municipality")
```

---
  
### Let's find the 'greenest' city in the CRD
  
In addition to normal logical predicates (`==`. `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.),
`filter()` can take *geometric predicates*:
  
`EQUALS`, `DISJOINT`, `INTERSECTS`, `TOUCHES`, `CROSSES`, `WITHIN`, `CONTAINS`, 
`OVERLAPS`, `DWITHIN`

```{r, cache=TRUE}
crd_greenspaces <- bcdc_query_geodata("local-and-regional-greenspaces") %>% 
  select(PARK_NAME, PARK_TYPE, PARK_PRIMARY_USE) %>% 
  filter(INTERSECTS(crd_mun)) %>% #<<
  collect()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
crd_greenspaces <- ms_simplify(crd_greenspaces) %>% st_make_valid() %>% 
  st_collection_extract("POLYGON")
```

.footnote[https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/local-and-regional-greenspaces]

---
```{r echo=FALSE}
mapviewOptions(leafletWidth = 1000, leafletHeight = 500)
```

  
```{r}
muni_map <- mapview(crd_mun, zcol = "ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION", 
                    layer = "Municipality")

muni_map + 
  mapview(crd_greenspaces, col.regions = "darkolivegreen")
```

---
## Find the amount of green space in each municipality
  
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
grn_intersected <- st_intersection(crd_greenspaces, crd_mun)

grn_intersected_summary <- group_by(grn_intersected, ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION) %>% 
  summarise(grn_area = sum(st_area(geometry)))

crd_mun <- left_join(crd_mun, st_drop_geometry(grn_intersected_summary), by = "ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION") %>% 
  mutate(muni_area = st_area(geometry),
         percent_green = (grn_area / muni_area) * 100)
```

---
  
```{r}
mapview(crd_mun, zcol = "percent_green", layer = "Percent Green")
```
