- We use all kinds of data - and a lot of it is spatial - make a lot of maps
- talk less about what we make, and more about how we make it, and why.

- hope that by sharing the workflows and processes that we've learned and work well for us it will give you some useful food for thought as you develop your careers as geomatics professionals.

Instead of spending a lot of time convincing you of R's spatial powers (which are many), I'm going to try to convince why using a tool like R is a good idea for any sort of analytical work, including spatial, which by the way R is REALLY good for.

I'm going to start off by describing a pretty common scenario, and then talk about how using **R** can help:

- You're doing a big project for a client. You have a four or five spatial files and a few csvs or Excel sheets containing data related to the spatial layers. 
- First you do a bunch of data cleaning in the spreadsheets - fixing date formats, unit conversions, transformations, unify inconsistent variable names, etc.

---

background-image: url(img/arcmap.jpg)

???

- You import the layers into a GIS, do a bunch of spatial operations - intersects, unions, buffers, spatial joins, etc.
- You import the tabular data and join it to the appropriate layers, and do more work.

---

???

- Spend some time creating really nice looking map for final report

---

background-image: url(img/graph.png)

???

- Export the tabular data out so you can summarize it and make some nice graphs in Excel

- Combine the results in a word document, convert it to a pdf and give to your client.

# What is R?

- R is an open-source programming language for data analysis and visualization.
  - In many ways it is similar to other general purpose interpreted languages like Python, but unlike Python, R was originally created as a statistical programming language and so it is designed from the ground up around the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of data - it is now often considered the 'lingua franca' of data.
  - It also easy to make publication-quality graphics.
  - R is available for Windows, MacOS and most popular Linux distributions.
  - You can run it interactively by typing directly into the console, or from a sequence of commands written in text files, or "scripts". Scripts can be run against a dataset to produce a defined output, such as a chart or another dataset which contains the results of the analysis.

# Efficiency

???

So, what can **R** give you?

---

background-image: url(img/branch_tweet.png)

---

background-image: url(img/full-cycle.png)

???

The entire workflow can be done efficiently in **R**, including:

- reading in raw data from many different sources - spatial and non-spatial, 
- preparing the data for analysis, including easily integrating tabular and spatial data,
- performing spatial data manipulation and analysis,
- performing statistical analysis
- creating publication-quality graphs and figures.

The entire workflow can be done efficiently in **R**, including:

- reading in raw data from many different sources - spatial and non-spatial, 
- preparing the data for analysis, including easily integrating tabular and spatial data,
- performing spatial data manipulation and analysis,
- performing statistical analysis
- creating publication-quality graphs and figures.
- All your iteration happens in one place, and is recorded in scripts

---

# Reproducibility

???

Reproducibilty means:

- *You can easily recreate or update exactly what you did*: 
  - In the scenario I described, If you coded the entire above workflow in an R script, you can just change a few lines to change the input data and rerun the scripts.
- *You know what you did*: 
  - Doing your data preparation and analysis by coding it in **R** necessarily documents every step. The analysis and documentation are inextricably intertwined.
- *Others know what you did*: 
  - They can inspect and re-run your code to understand what you did, verify you've done it correctly, and build on your work.

---

# Reliability

???

Using **R** can help you:

- *Minimize errors*: 
  - point and click and copy and paste operations are very error-prone, and it's hard to catch those errors
- And you can *find and correct errors* more easily: 
  - Changing a bit of code and re-running your script is much more efficient than doing it manually (without making another error).

# Versatility

???

R has a huge array of add-on packages that extend the capabilities of R for performing diverse tasks, including:

- data manipulation, 
- data visualization, and
- almost every statistical method you can think of
- With a wide range of packages R also supports advanced geospatial statistics, modeling and visualization.
- Packages are generally published on CRAN - or the "Comprehensive R Archive Network", these packages are easily installable by a user from within R.

I think one of the best reasons to use **R** is the:

Fantastic online **R** Community

- **R** is hugely popular right now.
- If you have a question or are having a problem, 99% of the time you'll find that it has already been asked and answered online. And if it hasn't, people are almost always willing to help out.

- hyped word, lots of definities out there
- To me - it's data analysis but inclusive of all steps of the data cycle, with a greater emphasis on programming.
- Spatial analysis can easily be fit into this framework, another side of the same coin.

Why R for spatial?

- Generally the same arguments as I made above for general data analysis.

- reading, writing and manipulating spatial data; making static and interactive maps; and spatial statistics and modelling

- Ability to seamlessly switch between spatial and non-spatial data processing, modeling and visualization tasks

  scale_fill_viridis_c() + theme_minimal()

### geometry generating logical operators

* `st_union`: union of several geometries
* `st_intersection`: intersection of pairs of geometries
* `st_difference`: difference between pairs of geometries
* `st_sym_difference`: symmetric difference (`xor`)

---

```{r eval=require(dplyr)}
dogs_and_hydrants <- st_join(dogs, hydrants) %>% 
  group_by(Neighbourh) %>% 
  summarize(licences = max(DogLicence), 
            n_hydrants = length(unique(ID)), 
            hydrants_per_dog = n_hydrants / licences)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(st_set_geometry(dogs_and_hydrants, NULL), format = "html")
```

???

### logical binary geometry predicates

* `st_intersects`: touch or overlap
* `st_disjoint`: !intersects
* `st_touches`: touch
* `st_crosses`: cross (don't touch)
* `st_within`: within
* `st_contains`: contains
* `st_overlaps`: overlaps
* `st_covers`: cover
* `st_covered_by`: covered by
* `st_equals`: equals
* `st_equals_exact`: equals, with some fuzz

### higher-level operations: summarise, interpolate, aggregate, st_join

* `aggregate` and `summarise` use `st_union` (by default) to group feature geometries
* `st_interpolate_aw`: area-weighted interpolation, uses `st_intersection` to interpolate or redistribute attribute values, based on area of overlap:
* `st_join` uses one of the logical binary geometry predicates (default: `st_intersects`) to join records in table pairs

### manipulating geometries

* `st_line_merge`: merges lines
* `st_segmentize`: adds points to straight lines
* `st_voronoi`: creates voronoi tesselation
* `st_centroid`: gives centroid of geometry
* `st_convex_hull`: creates convex hull of set of points
* `st_triangulate`: triangulates set of points (not constrained)
* `st_polygonize`: creates polygon from lines that form a closed ring
* `st_simplify`: simplifies lines by removing vertices
* `st_split`: split a polygon given line geometry
* `st_buffer`: compute a buffer around this geometry/each geometry
* `st_make_valid`: tries to make an invalid geometry valid (requires lwgeom)
* `st_boundary`: return the boundary of a geometry

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = dogs_and_hydrants, aes(fill = hydrants_per_dog)) +

```{r fig.width=8}
ggplot(dogs_and_hydrants, aes(x = Neighbourh, y = hydrants_per_dog)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = licences)) + scale_fill_viridis_c() + 
  coord_flip() + theme_minimal()
```
