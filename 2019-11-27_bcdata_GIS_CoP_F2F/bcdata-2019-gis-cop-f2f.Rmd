# What is R?

- R is an open-source programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- In many ways it is similar to other general purpose interpreted languages like Python, but unlike Python, R was originally created as a statistical programming language and so it is designed from the ground up around the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of data - it is now often considered the 'lingua franca' of data.
- It also easy to make publication-quality graphics.
- R is available for Windows, MacOS and most popular Linux distributions.
- You can run it interactively by typing directly into the console, or from a sequence of commands written in text files, or "scripts". Scripts can be run against a dataset to produce a defined output, such as a chart or another dataset which contains the results of the analysis.

# Why R?

The entire workflow can be done efficiently in **R**, including:

- reading in raw data from many different sources - spatial and non-spatial, 
- preparing the data for analysis, including easily integrating tabular and spatial data,
- performing spatial data manipulation and analysis,
- performing statistical analysis
- creating publication-quality graphs and figures.
- All your iteration happens in one place, and is recorded in scripts
- **enables reproducible, repeatable, shareable analysis**

BCGW Data Distribution Service

Way better than it was before

- Still a manual process
- Can't be scripted, not repeatable

# Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

APIs

Data BC provides important APIs:
- the catalogue
  - search and query data in the catalogue
- Web mapping service
  - download spatial data 
    - image overlay or the features themselves as points, lines, polygons

- As with most FOSS projects, initially made to solve personal problem, 
and several people had the same problem
- Solve (shared) friction point of manual searching and downloading data from BCDC
and getting it into R
