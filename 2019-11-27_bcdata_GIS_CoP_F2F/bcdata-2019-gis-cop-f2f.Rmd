# What is R?

- R is an open-source programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- In many ways it is similar to other general purpose interpreted languages like Python, but unlike Python, R was originally created as a statistical programming language and so it is designed from the ground up around the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of data - it is now often considered the 'lingua franca' of data.
- It also easy to make publication-quality graphics.
- R is available for Windows, MacOS and most popular Linux distributions.
- You can run it interactively by typing directly into the console, or from a sequence of commands written in text files, or "scripts". Scripts can be run against a dataset to produce a defined output, such as a chart or another dataset which contains the results of the analysis.

# Why R?

The entire workflow can be done efficiently in **R**, including:

- reading in raw data from many different sources - spatial and non-spatial, 
- preparing the data for analysis, including easily integrating tabular and spatial data,
- performing spatial data manipulation and analysis,
- performing statistical analysis
- creating publication-quality graphs and figures.
- All your iteration happens in one place, and is recorded in scripts
- **enables reproducible, repeatable, shareable analysis**

BCGW Data Distribution Service

Way better than it was before

- Still a manual process
- Can't be scripted, not repeatable

# Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

APIs

Data BC provides important APIs:
- the catalogue
  - search and query data in the catalogue
- Web mapping service
  - download spatial data 
    - image overlay (WMS) OR the features themselves as points, lines, polygons (WFS)

- As with most FOSS projects, initially made to solve personal problem, 
and several people had the same problem
- Solve (shared) friction point of manual searching and downloading data from BCDC
and getting it into R

## `bcdc_query_geodata()`

```{r}

### Select columns (attributes) with `select()`

```{r}
bcdc_query_geodata("municipalities-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc") %>% 
  select(ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION, ADMIN_AREA_GROUP_NAME)
```

---

### Filter rows (features) with `filter()`

  select(ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION, ADMIN_AREA_GROUP_NAME) %>% 
  filter(ADMIN_AREA_GROUP_NAME == "Capital Regional District")

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```


```{r}
crd_mun <- bcdc_query_geodata("municipalities-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc") %>%

```

---

### Let's find the 'greenest' city in the CRD

In addition to normal logical predicates (`==`. `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.),
`filter()` can take *geometric predicates*:

`EQUALS`, `DISJOINT`, `INTERSECTS`, `TOUCHES`, `CROSSES`, `WITHIN`, `CONTAINS`, 
`OVERLAPS`, `RELATE`, `DWITHIN`, `BEYOND`

```{r}
crd_greenspaces <- bcdc_query_geodata("local-and-regional-greenspaces") %>% 
  select(PARK_NAME, PARK_TYPE, PARK_PRIMARY_USE) %>% 
  filter(INTERSECTS(crd_mun)) %>% 
  collect()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
crd_greenspaces <- ms_simplify(crd_greenspaces) %>% st_make_valid() %>% 
  st_collection_extract("POLYGON")
```

---

```{r, fig.width=10}
muni_map <- mapview(crd_mun, zcol = "ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION", layer = "ADMIN_AREA")
muni_map + 
  mapview(crd_greenspaces, col.regions = "darkolivegreen")
```

---

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
grn_intersected <- st_intersection(crd_greenspaces, crd_mun)

grn_intersected_summary <- group_by(grn_intersected, 
                                    ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION) %>% 
  summarise(grn_area = sum(st_area(geometry)))

crd_mun <- left_join(crd_mun, st_drop_geometry(grn_intersected_summary), 
                     by = "ADMIN_AREA_ABBREVIATION") %>% 
  mutate(muni_area = st_area(geometry),
         percent_green = (grn_area / muni_area) * 100)
```
