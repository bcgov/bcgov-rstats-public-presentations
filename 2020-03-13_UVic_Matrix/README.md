### Abstract
BC Stats, the statistics bureau of the Province of British Columbia, has been providing quantitative evidence to support decision-making for over 125 years. In the past 5 years, the organization has moved purposefully to adopt data science practice, methods, and tools. This has been centred on the open source language R and other elements in that ecosystem.

We will present:

• The motivations behind the use of R, including reproducibility and other strategies to make our workflow more robust;
• Examples of the kinds of problems that a data scientist in the public service confronts; and
• How those problems have been tackled.

### Bios

**Julie Hawkins, B.Sc.**
Data Scientist

Julie joined BC Stats in 2001 as a Research Analyst, moved up the ranks as a Senior Research Analyst, Team Leader and then Manager, but demoted herself out of management to return to working directly with data. On the relatively new Data Science Team, Julie has been involved in multiple projects with R. Such projects include automating or improving co-workers’ programs (e.g., running the population app in Shiny, determining the top drivers of engagement from many possibilities, reporting on cumulative monthly housing data), writing an R replacement of outdated/expensive/confusing software (e.g., structural equation modelling in R instead of SPSS AMOS, raking population estimates in R instead of APL), auto-suppressing data results to maintain respondent confidentiality, conducting survey data analysis with custom functions from basic table creation (e.g., New Job Survey data analysis, BC Knowledge Development Fund Report) to an online dashboard or report generation (e.g., Elections BC Voters’ List Quality), and teaching opportunities (e.g., creation of in-house R package tutorials, presentation at the inaugural BCGov useR! Workshop).

Julie earned a Bachelor of Science degrees in Psychology, with a Minor in Statistics, from the University of Victoria. She tries to entice her sons to learn and use R, and has had many conversations with her sister about R functions and packages.

**Martin Monkman, B.Sc., M.A.**
Provincial Statistician & Director

Building on his previous experience analyzing data in a variety of contexts, Martin first joined BC Stats (British Columbia’s statistics bureau) in 1993. In subsequent years, Martin has built a wide range of experience using data science to support evidence-based policy and business management decisions. Now the Provincial Statistician & Director at BC Stats, Martin leads a dynamic and innovative team of data scientists in analyzing statistical information about the economic and social conditions of British Columbia, and measuring public sector organizational performance.
Martin also teaches Data Analytics Coding Fundamentals (BIDA 302) at UVic’s Continuing Studies, has taught an introductory R course at Simon Fraser University’s City Program, and is working on becoming a Carpentries instructor.

Martin holds Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts degrees in Geography from the University of Victoria., is a member of the Statistical Analysis Committee of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), and occasionally blogs about data science and the analysis of baseball statistics using R, the open-source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

**Stephanie Yurchak, B.Sc.**
Data Scientist

Stephanie joined BC Stats in 2015. She has predominantly been involved with government wide surveys, leading the analysis and reporting. Due to her R knowledge, her participation in these survey projects has reduced timelines for delivering reports and changed future expectations. Since joining the Data Science team in 2018, she continues to be a go-to person for report automation across BC Stats, and has branched out into new projects such as writing the BC Retail Sales Web App in Shiny and performing as a Subject Matter Expert for a contracted web development project.

Before joining BC Stats, Stephanie worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Victoria and a Methodologist at Statistics Canada. She earned a Bachelor of Science in Combined Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Victoria.
